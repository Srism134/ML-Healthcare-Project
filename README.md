# ML-Healthcare-Project

This project focuses on developing deep learning models for detecting Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC) from breast histopathology images.

##  Overview

The goal is to classify histopathology images into IDC-positive and IDC-negative categories using two deep learning approaches:

- **Model 1**: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- **Model 2**: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

##  Models

- **CNN**: Captures spatial features from image data.
- **LSTM**: Processes image features as sequential data to capture temporal patterns.

##  Dataset

- **Dataset**: Breast Histopathology Images  
- **Source**: [Kaggle - IDC classification](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/breast-histopathology-images)
- **Classes**:  
  - `0` — Negative (Non-IDC)  
  - `1` — Positive (IDC)

##  Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix

##  Technologies Used
